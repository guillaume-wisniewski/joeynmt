Modifications of JoeyNMT for the NeuroViz project

# Extraction of sentence representations

In the branch `repr_vizualization`. To get the code :
```
git clone git@github.com:guillaume-wisniewski/joeynmt.git
git fetch origin
git checkout repr_vizualization
```

If you want to see all existing branches:
```
git branch -a
```

To get the sentence representations, you must first translate your corpus:

```bash
./local/bin/python -m joeynmt --output_path OUTPUT_PREFIX translate JOEYNMT_CONFIG < CORPUS
```
where:

- JOEYNMT_CONFIG the filename containing the JoeyNMT's configuration;
- OUTPUT_PREFIX the filename in which the representations will be stored (with the extension XXX);
- CORPUS is the corpus containing source sentences (one sentence per line).

Other way to translate a corpus might work but have not been tested yet.

You must the call the `extract_representations.py` script to generate
a more friendly version of the representations stored in a pickle file.

```bash
./local/bin/python extract_representations.py --representations REPR_FILENAME --layer LAYER_NUMBER --input_sentences CORPUS --output OUTPUT_FILENAME
```
